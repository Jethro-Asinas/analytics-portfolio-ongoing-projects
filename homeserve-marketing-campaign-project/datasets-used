Zillow Home Value Index (Updated Monthly)

Zillow created the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) to track housing trends more accurately than traditional methods like median sale price, which can be skewed by which homes sell each month. Instead of using only actual sales, Zillow uses “Zestimates”—machine learning-based estimated prices for almost every home. This lets them measure trends across all homes, even those not sold, and avoid bias from changing sales mixes. ZHVI shows monthly median home values by ZIP code, city, and other regions, and segments the market by property type and price tiers. It excludes foreclosure sales directly but still reflects their market impact, giving a more consistent view of true home value changes over time.
